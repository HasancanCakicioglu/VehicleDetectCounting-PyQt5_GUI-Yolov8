The dataset includes 81 images.
Vehicle are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
